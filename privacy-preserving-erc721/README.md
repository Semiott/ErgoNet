## What Is The Non-Fungible Token ??
A non-fungible token (NFT) is a special type of cryptographic token which represents something unique; non-fungible tokens are thus not interchangeable. This is in contrast to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and many network or utility tokens that are fungible in nature.

Non-fungible tokens are used to create verifiable digital scarcity. NFTs are used in several specific applications that require unique digital items like crypto-collectibles and crypto-gaming. Popular blockchain games like CryptoKitties make use of non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain NFTs are used to represent in-game assets, which are in control of the user instead of the game developer NFTs also find potential use in digital art, by helping prove authenticity and ownership

The Ethereum community has adopted the ERC-721 protocol as a standard for Non-Fungible Tokens on Ethereum. Projects like CryptoKitties, CryptoPunks and Decentraland follow the ERC-721 protocol for their NFTs.

Non-fungible tokens made their way into mainstream news when CryptoKitties went viral and subsequently raised a $12.5 million investment RareBits, a Non-Fungible Token marketplace and exchange raised a $6 million investment. Gamedex, a collectible cards game platform made possible by Non-Fungible Tokens raised a $800,000 seed round. The creation of the Non-Fungible Token protocol on the Ethereum blockchain has caused other blockchain projects such as NEO to begin development of their own non-fungible token standards.


## What Is ERC-721??
ERC-721 is a free, open standard that describes how to build non-fungible or unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. While most tokens are fungible (every token is the same as every other token), ERC-721 tokens are all unique. Think of them like rare, one-of-a-kind collectables.

## THE STANDARD
ERC-721 defines a minimum interface a smart contract must implement to allow unique tokens to be managed, owned, and traded. It does not mandate a standard for token metadata or restrict adding supplemental functions.
